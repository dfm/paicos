# Running the examples and notebooks

We provide a number of examples in the subdirectories `examples/` and `ipython-notebooks`.

## Downloading sample data

This requires some example data which can be downloaded as follows. Open a terminal at
the root directory of the Paicos repo, then run
```
wget -O data/fof_subhalo_tab_247.hdf5 https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/BmILDaDPPz
wget -O data/snap_247.hdf5 https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/G4pUGFJUpq
```
